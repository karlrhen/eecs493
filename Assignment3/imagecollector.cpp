/***************************************************************************

ImageCollector retrieves a single pixmap from the web based on a url.

This is designed to be a singleton class.

Mark Ackerman    February 2014

To use this:

1.  Create an ImageCollector instance.  You will probably need only one.

2.  Get an image by calling loadImage() with the appropriate url in a
    QString.

3.  You can connect to the pixmapAvailable(pixmap) signal to get the
    pixmap when the image is finished downloading.
